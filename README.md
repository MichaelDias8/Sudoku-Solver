# Sudoku-Solver
This is the first application I developed which was way back before I'd taken any computer science courses. It is a console application which takes a partially solved suduko board from the user, and uses a recursive algorithm to fully solve the board. 
Debug/Sudoku-Solver.exe for runnable
